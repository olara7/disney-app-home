# Disney Plus Home Clone App

## Overview
This is a a clone app recreating the home page from the disney plus website. I decided to replicate the disney home menu because I was interested in how they made the hover over animations for the companies Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. I also wanted to know how to make sliders and implement them in the way that they did.

##### Technologies used: HTML & CSS | ReactJS | SwiperJS for the sliders
